# Kupuj-towary

my first React application 

Add and remove goods to your shopping cart, follow cost of purchase, and stock available, see budget overruns.\
Beware. Black Friday is coming 

In next version, removed funny math errors, added the currency calculator, removed funny math errors, added translations (much simpler than i18n), and of course removed funny math errors (again, many of them). Here we are.

In every progress code is becoming harder to understand, time to make modules, and some comments.

Next stage will be changing stylesheet (dark and a light modes). Plus got a real fetch of data for currency values.

Later, probably the latest one to do, admin page with a pseudologin for adding and removing wares.

So, the stages to do are:

- changing stylesheet
- fetch currency values from NBP API
- make an admin page with a pseudologin
- make an engine to add and remove wares for "admin"
- comments in code
- modules
- remove funny math errors
